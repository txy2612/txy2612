return number (which is the value of factorial of the parameter)
no factorial for negative --> invalid will return 0

int	ft_iterative_factorial(int nb)
{
	int	res;//res is used to accumulate the result of the factorial calculation
	int	count;//count is used as the iterator to traverse through each integer from 1 to nb.

	if (nb < 0)
	{
		return (0);
	}
	res = 1;//res & count = 1 bcz factorial of 0 = 1
	count = 1;//min fact res is 1 , we increment based on dat
	while (count <= nb)
